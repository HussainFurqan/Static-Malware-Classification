Static Malware Classification Using Deep Learning

Microsoft Data Set is used for this Classification

After the selection of dataset, the next step was to preprocess the data. The decision of using deep learning was to 
avoid the preprocessing of the data as it would take a lot of time and effort. Deep learning is very good at comparing
the sequences of data rather than machine learning. Furthermore, deep learning can work on raw hexadecimals in a very
effective way than machine learning. For the classification the malware samples, the hexadecimals of every malware sample
were collected and a new data set was created. To understand the creation of preprocessed data set, let’s take a look at 
the shape of the original data set. The original data set was in the form of folders where each folder contained a 
particular class of malware. In each folder, several malware samples were present, and with each sample there was a 
matching “.bytes” file of that particular malware sample.
The preprocessed data set was in the form of a “.png” file containing the malware samples and their matching class labels.
In each row, the first 65536 hexadecimals of a malware sample were placed and the class label was places at the end of the row.
In this way, more than 10,000 malware samples of 5 different classes with their first 65536 hexadecimals were placed in 
a .bytes file. Each hexadecimal has two values so the 2D matrix was created with 256 rows and 256 columns. 
In the second and final approach, the malware samples are converted to hexadecimals, and then the 2D images of these
hexadecimals were developed in “.png”. Afterwards, the images were given to the deep CNN model and the model was trained 
and validated.
